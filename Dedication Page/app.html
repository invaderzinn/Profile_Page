                        <p class="first">Chadwick Aaron Boseman (/ˈboʊzmən/; November 29, 1976 – August 28, 2020) was an American
                            actor and playwrite. After studying directing at Howard University, he became prominent in theater.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p class="first">Boseman achieved international fame for playing superhero Black Panther in the
                            <strong>Marvel
                                Cinematic Universe (MCU)</strong> from 2016 to 2019.
                            His role as King T'Challa was view by many within the Black Diaspora as pivtiol in the
                            roles
                            Blacks can play on screen and what audience, Black or
                            otherwise, will be exposed to. Many around the world organized events to see the film en masse in theaters. 
                            This was done to help cement its success so that
                            movie producers and executives would continue to promote Black/POC talent beyond racial stereotypes.

                        <p class="first" id="last">In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer. Boseman kept his condition private,
                            continuing
                            to act while also extensively supporting cancer
                            charities until his death in August 2020 from the illness. That same year two films,
                            <b>Da Five Bloods</b> and <b>Ma Rainy's Black Bottom</b>, received critcal acclaim at numerous awards
                            ceremonies,
                            the former winning him the Male Actor in a Leading Role award at the <u>27th Annual Screen
